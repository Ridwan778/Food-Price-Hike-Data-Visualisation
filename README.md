# Food Price Hike In Newfoundland during 2017-2022 (Data Visualisation)

## The goal of this project was to explore the affordability of food for Newfoundlanders

## How to run:
1. Install Anaconda if already not installed. Visit this page for more information on how to do that - https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows.html
2. Open Jupiter Notebook from inside Anaconda and navigate to the project repository.
3. Open the Food Price Analysis.ipynb file to interact with the plotly Treemap.

## Treemap Construction:
1. Blue elements have seen a price decrease and those in red have seen a price increase.
   
3. The space occupied by each element is determined by how much they contributed to the total change in price.

## Observations:
1. We see that 2021 and 2022 had the worst food price hikes between the years 2017-2022
   
2. The rise in cooking oil prices contributed heavily to the overall price hikes during 2021.
   
3. Vegetable cooking oil specifically went up the most during 2021.
   
5. The inflation rate for cooking oil still contributed the most to the price hikes in 2022. But Bread and Bakery items saw the biggest change as it went from 0.67% decrease in price during 2021 to a 24.5%  increase in price in 2022.
   
6. Over the years 2017,2018,2019 and 2020 we see that the inflation rate for these food items was between 2.5-5% which was still higher than the Canadian inflation rate over those years. Therefore, Newfoundlanders have been continually paying more to get their food even before the inflation crisis.
   
7. The situation got worse in 2021 when the food prices went up by more than 17%.
