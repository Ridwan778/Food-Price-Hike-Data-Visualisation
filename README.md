# Food Price Hike In Newfoundland during 2017-2021 Data Visualisation

## The goal of this project was to explore the affordability of food for Newfoundlanders

## Treemap Construction:
1. Blue elements have seen a price decrease and those in red have seen a price increase.
   
3. The space occupied by each element is determined by how much they contributed to the total change in price.

## Observations:
1. We see that 2021 had the worst food price hikes between the years 2021-2022
   
2. The rise in cooking oil prices contributed heavily to the overall price hikes during 2021.
   
3. Vegetable cooking oil specifically went up the most during 2021.
   
4. Over the years 2017,2018,2019 and 2020 we see that the inflation rate for these food items was between 2.5-5% which is higher than the Canadian inflation rate over those years. Therefore, Newfoundlanders have been continually paying more to get their food even before the inflation crisis.
   
5. The situation got worse in 2021 when the food prices went up by more than 17%.
